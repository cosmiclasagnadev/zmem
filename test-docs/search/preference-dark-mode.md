# Dark mode is preferred for development

The team prefers dark mode themes when working on code editors and terminal applications. This preference helps reduce eye strain during long coding sessions.

## Rationale

- Reduced eye strain in low-light environments
- Lower power consumption on OLED screens
- Better visibility of syntax highlighting
- More comfortable for night-time work

## Implementation

- Default new installations to dark theme
- Store theme preference in user settings
- Support system theme auto-detection
